	<br>Hi! I am Jerson Yago of 11 TVL PERL I study at San Francisco High School
	<br>and my strand is TVL Programming.
	<br>
	<br>The reason why I choose Programming, that's because there are a lot of people using 
	<br>technology today, and the use of technology is still growing
	<br>so I thought it would be good to learn about technology or programming.
	<br>
	<br>I also believe that I can get a lot of jobs learning programming.
	<br>I really enjoyed learning how to program, like making my own website, 
	<br>so I would like to learn more about how to program.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>That's all
	<h1>Thank You!</h1>
